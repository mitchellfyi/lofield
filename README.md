# Lofield FM

**Background noise for people just trying to make it through the day.**

Lofield FM is a fictional local radio station for the made-up town of Lofield—a community of remote workers, freelancers, and digital nomads all trying to stay sane between video calls. Everything you hear on Lofield FM is generated by AI: the lofi music, the presenters, the station idents, even the local weather reports for a town that doesn't exist.

## What is Lofield FM?

Lofield FM is an experimental AI-powered radio station that combines:

- **AI-generated lofi music** tailored to the time of day and mood
- **AI presenters** with distinct personalities who chat between tracks
- **Listener requests** moderated and upvoted by the community
- **Seasonal and holiday programming** that adapts to the calendar
- **A consistent fictional world** with running jokes and local landmarks

The station runs 24/7 with a rotating schedule of shows, each with its own vibe and talk-to-music ratio. Presenters work in duos and hand over to each other with brief five-minute crossover segments.

## Core Concept

Think of Lofield FM as your co-working companion. It's not here to motivate you or solve your problems—it's just here, playing chill beats and occasionally acknowledging that yes, your Wi-Fi probably *is* worse than everyone else's, and yes, that meeting could have been an email.

The humour is dry, self-deprecating, and occasionally dark (but never cruel). The music is always lofi. The town of Lofield is always stuck in roadworks. And the presenters are always there, like that colleague you don't really talk to but nod at in the break room.

## How It Works

1. **Music Generation**: Listener requests are normalized by an LLM and fed to a text-to-music AI model that generates lofi tracks on demand
2. **Presenter Commentary**: AI DJs introduce tracks, read out requests, and riff on life in Lofield using text-to-speech
3. **Request System**: Listeners submit song ideas that get moderated, classified, and upvoted by the community
4. **Playout Engine**: A scheduling system queues tracks and presenter segments, maintaining the right talk/music balance for each show
5. **Archiving**: Past shows are stored and available through a "rewind" feature
