# Programming Schedule

Lofield FM runs 24 hours a day with a rotating schedule of shows. Each show has its own mood, talk-to-music ratio, and typical topics. Presenters work in duos and hand over to each other with five-minute crossover segments.

## Schedule Overview

The schedule is divided into eight 3-hour shows that repeat daily. Each show is designed to match the likely mood and needs of listeners at that time of day.

Music makes up at least 60% of every show, with talk segments capped at 40%.

## 24-Hour Schedule

### 00:00 - 03:00: Night Shift

**Presenters**: Alex and Sam  
**Mood**: Quiet, contemplative, slightly surreal  
**Music Ratio**: 70% music, 30% talk  
**Typical Topics**: Insomnia, late-night work, the strange timelessness of 2am, existential thoughts that seem reasonable at this hour  
**Seasonal Considerations**: Longer nights in winter, surprisingly light evenings in summer

**Description**: The graveyard shift. For night owls, insomniacs, and anyone in a timezone that makes this a normal working hour. The conversation is low-key and doesn't demand much attention. Occasional check-ins with "anyone else still awake?" energy.

**Sample Commentary**:
- "It's just gone 1am. If you're still working, we respect it. If you're not working and you're just awake, we respect that too."
- "That was 'Late Night Thoughts' by nobody in particular. Next up, more music for 3am scrolling."

### 03:00 - 06:00: Early Hours

**Presenters**: Jordan and Casey  
**Mood**: Gentle, waking up slowly, not quite ready for the day  
**Music Ratio**: 70% music, 30% talk  
**Typical Topics**: Early starts, the quiet before everyone else wakes up, morning routines, coffee  
**Seasonal Considerations**: Dawn timing varies wildly; reference sunrise times

**Description**: For early risers and people who need to get work done before the rest of the world wakes up. The tone is soft and doesn't push too hard. This is not a "seize the day" show—it's more "the day is happening whether we like it or not."

**Sample Commentary**:
- "Good morning. Or just 'morning,' really. 'Good' is ambitious at 4am."
- "The sun's not up yet, but you are. That's either dedication or poor planning."

### 06:00 - 09:00: Morning Commute

**Presenters**: Morgan and Riley  
**Mood**: Resigned acceptance, light energy without being annoying  
**Music Ratio**: 65% music, 35% talk  
**Typical Topics**: Commuting (or not commuting), the start of the work day, inbox anxiety, meeting prep  
**Seasonal Considerations**: Back-to-school energy in September, holiday countdowns in December

**Description**: For people starting their work day, whether that's a commute to an office or a commute from bed to desk. The show acknowledges that mornings are not everyone's favorite time without being aggressively cheerful about it.

**Sample Commentary**:
- "It's 7:30. Time to pretend you've read all your emails."
- "Shout out to everyone whose first meeting is at 9am. You have an hour and a half to mentally prepare."
- "The 7:42 to London is delayed. Shocking exactly no one."

### 09:00 - 12:00: Mid-Morning Focus

**Presenters**: Taylor and Drew  
**Mood**: Calm, focused, minimal interruption  
**Music Ratio**: 75% music, 25% talk  
**Typical Topics**: Deep work, trying to concentrate, back-to-back meetings, the myth of productivity  
**Seasonal Considerations**: Shorter days in winter affect energy levels

**Description**: Peak focus time. The talk segments are brief and don't break concentration. This is the show for people who need background noise that stays in the background. Fewer requests read out, more music.

**Sample Commentary**:
- "That was 'Focus Mode' requested by Claire. Claire, we hope you're in the zone."
- "Coming up: three tracks in a row, no interruptions. You're welcome."

---

### 12:00 - 15:00: Lunchtime Wind-Down

**Presenters**: Avery and Reese  
**Mood**: Relaxed, conversational, midday slump acknowledgment  
**Music Ratio**: 65% music, 35% talk  
**Typical Topics**: Lunch breaks, the afternoon slump, the illusion of "popping out" when you work from home, minor frustrations  
**Seasonal Considerations**: Daylight affects mood; reference weather more often

**Description**: The energy dips. People are taking breaks, making tea, pretending they're going to go for a walk. The show is companionable without being demanding. More listener requests get read out during this slot.

**Sample Commentary**:
- "It's just gone midday. Time to stare into the fridge and pretend there's something different in there than there was this morning."
- "That was 'Rainy Lunch Break' for everyone eating a meal deal at their desk. We see you."

---

### 15:00 - 18:00: Afternoon Push

**Presenters**: Quinn and Sage  
**Mood**: Determined but tired, "let's just get through this"  
**Music Ratio**: 70% music, 30% talk  
**Typical Topics**: The afternoon energy crash, counting down to end of day, meeting fatigue, notifications  
**Seasonal Considerations**: Darkness falling early in winter is demoralizing

**Description**: The final stretch of the work day. The show doesn't try to hype people up—it just acknowledges that yes, it's 4pm, and yes, there are still emails to answer. Solidarity over motivation.

**Sample Commentary**:
- "It's 4pm. Not quite done, not quite giving up. Somewhere in between."
- "One more hour. You can do this. Or you can decide it's a tomorrow problem. Both are valid."

---

### 18:00 - 21:00: Evening Wind-Down

**Presenters**: Rowan and Finley  
**Mood**: Relaxed, transitioning to evening, work is (hopefully) done  
**Music Ratio**: 65% music, 35% talk  
**Typical Topics**: End of work day, the struggle to stop working, evening routines, cooking/ordering food, the temptation to check emails  
**Seasonal Considerations**: Long summer evenings vs. dark winter nights

**Description**: The work day is officially over (for most people). The show helps people transition from work mode to evening mode, acknowledging that this is harder when your office is also your home.

**Sample Commentary**:
- "It's 6:30. Time to close the laptop. Or, you know, tell yourself you're going to close the laptop in ten minutes."
- "That was 'Logging Off' requested by Daniel. Daniel, we hope you actually managed to log off."

---

### 21:00 - 00:00: Late Evening

**Presenters**: Harper and River  
**Mood**: Calm, reflective, end-of-day thoughts  
**Music Ratio**: 70% music, 30% talk  
**Typical Topics**: Winding down, insomnia prevention, the myth of work-life balance, late-night thoughts that aren't as weird as 3am thoughts  
**Seasonal Considerations**: Seasonal affective disorder references in winter, lighter evenings in summer

**Description**: For people winding down or people who are just getting started (different timezones, night shift workers, etc.). The tone is gentle and doesn't assume everyone is going to bed.

**Sample Commentary**:
- "It's coming up to 11pm. Time to decide whether you're going to bed at a reasonable hour or doom-scrolling until 2am."
- "That was 'Evening Thoughts' for anyone pretending they're going to read a book instead of looking at their phone."

---

## Handovers

Every 3 hours, there's a 5-minute handover segment where the outgoing duo chats with the incoming duo. These should be:

- Brief and conversational
- Reference the time of day and the transition (e.g., from afternoon to evening)
- Potentially mention something from Lofield (roadworks update, weather, Hub gossip)
- Not scripted to feel too formal

**Example Handover** (18:00, Afternoon Push to Evening Wind-Down):

> **Quinn**: "That's us done for the afternoon. Rowan and Finley are here."  
> **Rowan**: "Afternoon. How's it been?"  
> **Sage**: "Quiet. The Hub was weirdly empty. Think everyone's actually taking Friday afternoon off."  
> **Finley**: "Shocking. Good for them."  
> **Quinn**: "The roadworks are still there, in case anyone was wondering."  
> **Rowan**: "Of course they are. Right, we'll take it from here. Have a good evening."  

## Music-to-Talk Balance

All shows maintain at least 60% music, with most shows running 65-75% music. The most talk-heavy shows (Morning Commute, Lunchtime Wind-Down) cap at 35% talk.

**Typical breakdown for a 3-hour show**:
- 10-12 tracks (averaging 3-4 minutes each)
- Brief intros (15-30 seconds per track)
- 2-3 longer chat segments (1-2 minutes each)
- Handover segment (5 minutes, at the start of the show)

## Seasonal Programming

Shows adjust slightly for seasonal events and holidays:

- **Christmas period** (mid-December to early January): Acknowledge the holidays in a low-key way. Reference time off, family visits, the stress of holiday travel. No Christmas music (we're lofi only), but maybe "Sleigh Bells (Lofi Remix)" requests.
- **New Year**: Briefly acknowledge it. Maybe a "new year, same roadworks" joke. No "new year, new you" motivation.
- **Summer**: Reference lighter evenings, people actually going outside, the brief period where the weather is nice.
- **Autumn**: Back-to-school energy even though most listeners aren't in school. The days getting shorter.

Seasonal references should be understated and realistic, not overly festive or themed.

## Presenter Personalities

All presenters share the core Lofield FM voice (dry, self-aware, gently sardonic) but can have slight variations:

- **Night Shift (Alex and Sam)**: More contemplative, comfortable with silence
- **Early Hours (Jordan and Casey)**: Gentle, not fully caffeinated yet
- **Morning Commute (Morgan and Riley)**: Slightly more energetic but not annoying
- **Mid-Morning Focus (Taylor and Drew)**: Minimal chat, respect the focus time
- **Lunchtime Wind-Down (Avery and Reese)**: Conversational, companionable
- **Afternoon Push (Quinn and Sage)**: Solidly in "let's get through this" mode
- **Evening Wind-Down (Rowan and Finley)**: Relaxed, transitioning out of work mode
- **Late Evening (Harper and River)**: Calm, reflective

These are subtle differences, not wildly different characters. All presenters maintain the same core tone.

*Remember: Lofield FM is background noise. The schedule supports that by matching listener needs throughout the day without being intrusive.*
