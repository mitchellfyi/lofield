# Town Bible: Lofield

Lofield is a fictional town that exists only in the context of Lofield FM. It's a small British town where everyone seems to work remotely, and the infrastructure is perpetually one step behind the demands of modern digital life.

## Overview

Lofield isn't based on any real place, but it feels like it could be. It has the bones of a market town that's been repurposed for the laptop class: co-working spaces in converted churches, artisan coffee shops with questionable Wi-Fi, and a high street that's mostly charity shops and vape stores.

The town is neither urban nor rural—it's that in-between space where you can get decent coffee but you'll never get fiber broadband. Everyone who lives here is either working remotely, freelancing, or "between projects."

## Key Landmarks and Running Jokes

### The Eternal Roadworks

**Location**: The High Street  
**Status**: "Nearly finished" (since January, year unspecified)

The roadworks on the High Street are Lofield's most consistent feature. No one remembers what they're for. The council keeps saying they're almost done. The diggers have been there so long that people have started naming them.

**Usage in scripts**: Reference them to indicate the passage of time, or as a metaphor for anything that drags on forever.

**Examples**:
- "The roadworks are now in their third year. At this point they're less 'roadworks' and more 'an outdoor sculpture installation.'"
- "Traffic is moving slowly through the High Street. But then again, it always is."

### The Hub (Co-working Café)

**Location**: Former Methodist chapel on Church Lane  
**Status**: Open 7am-6pm weekdays, sporadically on weekends

The Hub is where everyone in Lofield works. It's a converted chapel with exposed brick, mismatched furniture, and Wi-Fi that works perfectly *most* of the time. The coffee is good. The acoustics are weird (it's a former chapel). There's always one person on a video call who forgot to mute.

**Signature drink**: The "Flat White Noise" (a flat white, but they call it that)

**Usage in scripts**: Reference The Hub when talking about co-working, coffee, or the general experience of working in public.

**Examples**:
- "Shout out to everyone at The Hub trying to look busy between meetings."
- "If you're at The Hub and you can hear an echo, that's just the acoustics. Or ghosts. Probably acoustics."

### The Dodgy Wi-Fi Triangle

**Location**: The area bounded by the High Street, Park Road, and Station Approach  
**Status**: Persistently unreliable

For reasons no one can explain, internet connectivity in this specific area of Lofield is terrible. Mobile data doesn't work. Home broadband drops out. Even The Hub's Wi-Fi gets flaky near the windows. Locals have theories (underground water, old mine shafts, government conspiracy), but the real reason is probably just bad infrastructure.

**Usage in scripts**: Mention when discussing connectivity issues, dropped calls, or technical frustrations.

**Examples**:
- "If your connection just dropped, you might be in the Triangle. Our condolences."
- "Remember: if you're moving to Lofield, check the Wi-Fi before you sign the lease. Especially if it's near Park Road."

### The Station (Train Station)

**Location**: Station Approach  
**Status**: Two platforms, limited service

Lofield Station has trains to Actual Places with Actual Jobs, but not very often. There's one to London in the morning, one back in the evening, and a sporadic service to the nearest city. The waiting room has free Wi-Fi, which makes it one of the most popular co-working spots in town (despite the uncomfortable seating).

**Usage in scripts**: Reference when talking about commuting, travel, or the tension between remote work and in-person obligations.

**Examples**:
- "The 7:42 to London is delayed. In other news, water is wet."
- "For those of you working from the station waiting room, respect. That's dedication."

### The Green

**Location**: Town center, near the High Street  
**Status**: Decent for lunch breaks

A small park with benches, a memorial to something (no one remembers what), and surprisingly good mobile reception. It's where people go to take calls, eat meal-deal sandwiches, and pretend they're "going for a walk" when they're really just escaping their home office for ten minutes.

**Usage in scripts**: Reference when talking about breaks, fresh air, or the illusion of work-life balance.

**Examples**:
- "If you're on your third 'walk around The Green' today, we see you."
- "The Green: where everyone goes to take the exact same phone call."

## Secondary Locations

These can be referenced occasionally for variety:

- **The Market**: Happens on Saturdays. Mostly vegetables and phone cases.
- **Greggs**: It's a Greggs. You know what it is.
- **The Library**: Free Wi-Fi, quiet, slightly judgmental librarians. Popular with freelancers who can't afford The Hub.
- **The Ring Road**: Bypasses the town center and the roadworks. Not actually a ring.
- **The Industrial Estate**: On the outskirts. Home to a self-storage place, a trade counter, and a surprisingly good kebab shop.

## Demographics and Culture

Lofield's population is roughly 15,000, though the number fluctuates as people move in search of cheaper rent and better broadband. The town skews young-ish (25-45) and laptop-based. Everyone seems to be:

- A graphic designer
- A content writer
- A software developer
- "Working on a startup"
- "Between contracts"

The local economy is held together by coffee shops, co-working memberships, and the occasional Deliveroo order.

## Weather and Seasons

Lofield experiences normal British weather: grey and drizzly most of the time, with occasional nice days that everyone talks about for weeks. Seasonal references should be understated and matter-of-fact.

**Examples**:
- "It's raining. Again. Surprising exactly no one."
- "The temperature has dropped to the point where you need to decide whether to turn the heating on or just wear a jumper. Choose wisely."
- "That was three consecutive days of sunshine. It's over now, of course."

## Local News and Events

Lofield doesn't have much in the way of news, which is part of its charm. Occasional references can include:

- The council's latest vague announcement about the roadworks
- The Hub introducing a new type of milk (oat milk, probably)
- Someone's cat getting stuck somewhere
- A new coffee shop opening (it will close within six months)
- The annual Summer Fair (it's fine)

## Tone and Usage

When referencing Lofield in presenter scripts:

- Keep it low-key and matter-of-fact
- Don't overexplain (listeners will pick up the running jokes)
- Mix in real locations occasionally to keep it grounded ("Sarah in Sheffield," "Tom in Leeds")
- Remember that Lofield is a backdrop, not the main character

The town exists to give the station a sense of place and continuity. It's not trying to be a rich fictional universe—it's just a consistently rendered setting for some light, dry humour.
